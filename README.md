# PDF Query System

This project lets you upload a PDF, extract text, and ask questions about its content. It uses a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline for text retrieval and question-answering.

## Features

- **Extract Text from PDFs**: Choose specific pages to extract text.  
- **Ask Questions**: Enter a query, and the system retrieves answers from the PDF.  
- **Interactive Interface**: Use a simple Streamlit app for uploads and queries.

## How It Works

1. **Text Extraction**: Reads text from specified pages using `PyPDF2`.  
2. **Chunking**: Splits text into smaller parts for processing.  
3. **Embedding**: Converts chunks into numerical representations with `SentenceTransformer`.  
4. **Retrieval**: Finds relevant text chunks using FAISS.  
5. **Answer Generation**: Uses OpenAI’s language model to answer queries based on retrieved text.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Libraries:  
  `PyPDF2`, `sentence-transformers`, `faiss`, `langchain`, `streamlit`

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Add your OpenAI API key in the code.

## How to Use

1. Run the app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. Upload a PDF in the app.

3. Enter a question and (optionally) specify pages.

4. View the response generated by the system.

## Example

- Upload a PDF with statistics.  
- Ask: *What is the unemployment rate for bachelor's degrees?*  
- Get an answer based on the PDF content.
